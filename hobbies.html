          <h2>Dota and Dota2</h2>
          <p>Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne.</p>
          <p> Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams that consist of five players, with both teams occupying their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently control a powerful character, known as a "hero", that each feature unique abilities and different styles of play. During a match, a player and their team collects experience points and items for their heroes in order to fight through the opposing team's defenses. A team wins by being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team's base, called the "Ancient". (From Wikipedia)</p>
          <p>I knew this game in 2008. However, I started to take this game seriously in 2010. And I have kept playing this game for 4 years. I spent a lot of time practicing my skill and thinking about the strategy. Although I am not talented enough to become a pro-player, I enjoyed every game I played. In the summer of 2014, because I met my girlfriend and playing DOTA2 consumed so much of my time, I stopped playing DOTA2. But I still watch professional matches such as The International.</p>

          <h2>HearthStone</h2>
          <p>Hearthstone, originally known as Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, is a free-to-play online collectible card video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. Having been released worldwide on March 11, 2014, Hearthstone builds upon the already existing lore of the Warcraft series by using the same elements, characters, and relics. It was first released for Microsoft Windows and macOS, with support for iOS and Android devices being added later. The game features cross-platform play, allowing players on any device to compete with each other, restricted only by geographical region account limits.</p>
          <p>The game is a turn-based card game between two opponents, using constructed decks of thirty cards along with a selected hero with a unique power. Players use mana points to cast spells or summon minions to attack the opponent, with the goal to reduce the opponent's health to zero. Winning matches can earn in-game gold, rewards in the form of new cards, and other in-game prizes. Players can then buy packs of new cards through gold or microtransactions to customize and improve their decks. The game features several modes of play, including casual and ranked matches, as well as daily quests and weekly challenges to help earn more gold and cards. New content for the game involves the addition of new card sets and gameplay, taking the form of either expansion packs or single-player adventures that reward the player with collectible cards upon completion. (From Wikipedia)</p>
          <p>I discovered Hearthstone in 2014. Compared to DOTA2, Hearthstone takes less time and makes me feel more mentallay challenged. My favorite decks are freeze Mage and Control Warlock. Both of them are mid-ranged control decks.</p>

          <h2>Overwatch</h2>
          <p>Overwatch is a team-based online multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. It was released in May 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. </p>
          <p>Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting one of 24 pre-defined characters, called heroes, each with unique movement, attributes, and abilities, whose roles are divided into four categories: Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character skins and victory poses, as they play the game. The game was initially launched with casual play, with a competitive ranked mode, various 'arcade' game modes, and a player-customizable server browser subsequently included following its release. Additionally, Blizzard has developed and added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, while stating that all Overwatch updates will remain free, with the only additional cost to players being microtransactions to earn additional cosmetic rewards.</p>
          <p>Overwatch is the game I am currently playing. I play mainly tank and heals. It doesn't mean that I can't aim. I believe that a person's personality decides one's preference and performance for different heroes. People who is more self-centered would like to choose offense heroes because they can deal more damage. People who is more tendered and team-proned would like to choose tank or support hero. I did a great job on tank heroes, especially Reinhardt, and support heroes, especially Ana. Last Season, I managed to reach Diamond Rank, which is top 8% of all players.</p>

          <h2>Fate/Grand Order</h2>
          <p>Fate/Grand Order is an online free-to-play role-playing game based on the Fate/stay night visual novel game and franchise by Type-Moon. The game is centered around turn-based combat where the player, who takes on the role of a "Master", summons and commands powerful familiars known as "Servants" in battle against their enemies. The story narrative is presented in a visual novel format, and each Servant has their own personal scenario which the player explores. It was first released on July 29, 2015 on Android, with a subsequent release on August 12 on iOS. An English release is scheduled for Q2/Q3 2017 in the United States.</p>
          <p>I am a big fan of Fate/stay night. The story itself is intriguing, and the characters are very attractive. In Fate/Grand Order, player can collect and train different Servants from all over the world. If you are a Type-Moon fan or you are a fan of particular myth hero, Fate/Grand Order is a very good game!. </p>

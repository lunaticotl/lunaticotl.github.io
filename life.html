        <p>1995 August 7th, I was born in Shanghai, China</p>

        <p>I love my parents. They have sacrificed a lot to support me. I will try my best to make them live better</p>

        <p>I was graduated from No.1 High School Affiliated to China Eastern Normal Univeristy. This is where everything begins. I learned a lot from in this place.</p>

        <p>In 2013, I started my life in America. University of Miami has borne a lot of precious memories. Sadly, I am about to graduate. However, my future is not decided yet. It's time to look forward!</p>
